YEAR 2075 - Most professors are gone from the public life, they are unreachable. We are left with some computational infrastructure and some AI agents that used to be the hype about 50 years ago... things have been going quite well so far, but...
...there seems to be some kind of a new virus... infecting people, easy to spot symptoms include diarrhea and fever, we no longer studied Biology or Mathematics... or anything Medical in depth, so we don't really know what it is, but we know it is really contagious. How can we figure out what is happening and stop its spread, especially to children which seem very vulnerable? The only people that seem to be affected less by it, thus are able to interact with those infected are athletes that were taking significant levels of calcium supplements, they don't seem to be infected that much. What could it be? How would you start investigating this using AI tools and HPC clusters?... and that's the start of our workshop...

(Disclaimer: The story might not have every detail arranged and thus might not be perfect, but it will still make you think...)
(For now, let's make sure we have HPC access...)
